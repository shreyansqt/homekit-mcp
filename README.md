# HomeKit MCP Research

Research and product outline for a local Apple Home / HomeKit helper that can sync Apple Home metadata with Home Assistant and expose safe tools over MCP.

Status: research / viability assessment. The tracked files are sanitized for public review: examples use placeholder home/device names and the Xcode project does not include a personal Apple developer team ID.

## Local helper and CLI

The Mac Catalyst helper lives in [`App/HomeKitMCPHelper`](App/HomeKitMCPHelper). It owns all HomeKit access and exposes a localhost-only HTTP API while running:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /inventory`
- `POST /mcp`

A native macOS menu-bar wrapper lives in [`App/HomeKitMCPMenuBar`](App/HomeKitMCPMenuBar). It is an `LSUIElement` AppKit status item that keeps HomeKit access in the Catalyst helper, reads health/inventory from `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, opens the helper window, refreshes status, restarts the helper LaunchAgent, and quits only the wrapper.

Use the Python standard-library CLI wrapper in [`bin/homekit-mcp`](bin/homekit-mcp):

```bash
bin/homekit-mcp health
bin/homekit-mcp inventory
bin/homekit-mcp inventory --home "Example Home"
bin/homekit-mcp mcp --json '{"tool":"homekit_inventory","arguments":{"home":"Example Home"}}'
```

See [`cli/README.md`](cli/README.md) for detailed usage, including mutation planning/apply examples.

## Local configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local-only shell settings if desired. Do not commit `.env` or real Apple developer team IDs. For signed local builds, pass your own team ID to `xcodebuild` or set it in Xcode locally:

```bash
cd App/HomeKitMCPHelper
xcodebuild \
  -project HomeKitMCPHelper.xcodeproj \
  -scheme HomeKitMCPHelper \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,variant=Mac Catalyst' \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOURTEAMID \
  build
```
